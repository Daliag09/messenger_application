The Messenger Application is a real-time chat platform designed to facilitate seamless communication between users through instant messaging and multimedia sharing. The application allows users to send and receive messages in one-on-one and group chats, manage their contacts, and personalize their profiles. To ensure a safe and organized environment, administrators have the ability to moderate content, manage users, and review reports.


The primary objective of this project is to develop a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly messenger software designe that supports real-time communication while ensuring security, privacy, and moderation. The designe will be build with an event-driven architecture using the Observer Pattern to handle real-time message delivery.
